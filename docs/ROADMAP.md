## Current Status (v1.8.0)

### Completed
- 30+ hands-on labs covering ML, LLM, DFIR, Cloud, and adversarial techniques
- 15 CTF challenges (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- Multi-provider LLM support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Docker Compose lab environment with Jupyter, Elasticsearch, Ollama
- Cloud-Native Security Track (Labs 19b-d)
- AI/ML Security Track (Labs 17b-c, 18b)

### In Progress
