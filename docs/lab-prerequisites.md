| **Know Python, want LLMs** | Lab 08 | 04 → 04b → 05 |
| **Know ML, want LLMs** | Lab 03b | 04 → 04b → 05 |
| **Security analyst, want AI tools** | Lab 04 | 05 → 06 → 09 |
| **Want DFIR focus** | Lab 25 | 11a → 11 → 13 |

## Key Bridge Labs

These labs help you transition between major topics:

| Bridge Lab | What It Bridges | When to Use |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Lab 03b** | ML → LLM | If Lab 04 feels like a big jump from Labs 01-03 |
| **Lab 04b** | Single tasks → Agents | Before Lab 05 if tool calling is new |
| **Lab 25** | General → DFIR | Before Lab 11 if DFIR concepts are new |
| **Lab 30** | General → Ransomware | Before Lab 11 for ransomware background |

## Quick Reference: What Each Lab Needs

### Foundation (00x) - No prerequisites
All 00x labs can be done independently. Start with whichever matches your gap.

### ML Track (01-03)
- **Lab 01**: Needs 04 concepts (or ML experience)
- **Lab 02**: Needs Lab 01
- **Lab 03**: Needs Lab 02

### LLM Track (04-07)
- **Lab 04**: Needs API skills (08) and an API key
- **Lab 05**: Needs Lab 04b (tool calling basics)
- **Lab 06**: Needs Lab 04 + embeddings concept (06a helps)
- **Lab 07**: Needs Lab 04 + malware concepts (02 or 07a)

### Advanced (08+)
Most advanced labs combine skills from both ML and LLM tracks. Check individual lab READMEs for specifics.

## Still Unsure?

- **Try Lab 01** - If it makes sense, continue to 02, 03
- **Try Lab 04** - If API calls are confusing, do 08 first
- **Ask in the lab** - Each notebook has a "Prerequisites" section at the top
