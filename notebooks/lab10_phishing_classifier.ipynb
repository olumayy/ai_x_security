    "In this lab, we built a phishing email classifier using:\n",
    "- **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert email text to numerical features\n",
    "- **Random Forest classifier** for robust classification\n",
    "- **Evaluation metrics** including precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Phishing Indicators Identified:\n",
    "- Urgency words (\"urgent\", \"immediately\", \"act now\")\n",
    "- Financial incentives (\"won\", \"prize\", \"free\")\n",
    "- Security threats (\"compromised\", \"suspended\", \"verify\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. Add more training data\n",
    "2. Try deep learning models (BERT, RoBERTa)\n",
    "3. Add header analysis features\n",
    "4. Integrate with email gateway"
