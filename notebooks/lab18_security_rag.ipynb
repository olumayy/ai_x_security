Sources: Commercial feeds (Mandiant, Recorded Future, Unit 42), open source (AlienVault OTX, abuse.ch), ISACs, government (CISA). Integration points: Firewall blocking, SIEM enrichment, EDR watchlists, email gateway. Lifecycle: Collection -> Processing -> Analysis -> Dissemination -> Feedback.

Key matrices: Enterprise (Windows, Linux, macOS, Cloud), Mobile, ICS. Layers to maintain: Current coverage, target coverage, red team scope. Data sources: Map required visibility to technique detection (process creation for T1059). Sub-techniques: Provide specific detection opportunities (T1003.001 LSASS vs T1003.003 NTDS).\"\"\",\n",

Automation: Use WSUS/SCCM/Intune for Windows, Ansible/Chef/Puppet for Linux, cloud-native patching for cloud instances. Third-party applications often more risky than OS - prioritize browser, PDF readers, Java. Monthly patch cycle aligned with Patch Tuesday typical for most organizations.\"\"\",\n",

    "### Why RAG Matters for Security\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grounded Answers**: LLM responses are based on YOUR documentation, not generic training data\n",
    "2. **Reduced Hallucination**: Model can only cite what's in the retrieved docs\n",
    "3. **Up-to-Date**: Add new playbooks without retraining the model\n",
    "4. **Citation**: Can point to exact source documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating RAG Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "When reviewing RAG output, check:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Good Sign | Red Flag |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|----------|\n",
    "| **Relevance** | Answer addresses the question | Generic or off-topic response |\n",
    "| **Grounding** | Information matches source docs | Claims not in retrieved docs |\n",
    "| **Completeness** | Covers key points from docs | Missing important procedures |\n",
    "| **Actionability** | Clear next steps provided | Vague or theoretical advice |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common RAG Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval Failure**: Wrong documents retrieved\n",
    "   - *Solution*: Better embeddings, more documents, query expansion\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Context Overflow**: Too much context confuses LLM\n",
    "   - *Solution*: Better chunking, smarter document selection\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Hallucination Despite Context**: LLM ignores retrieved docs\n",
    "   - *Solution*: Prompt engineering, lower temperature"
