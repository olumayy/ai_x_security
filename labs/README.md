3. **Set up your environment** - all dependencies installed
4. **Configure API keys** - especially for LLM labs

### While Working

1. **Start with starter code** - don't look at solutions first
2. **Work through TODOs** in order
3. **Test incrementally** - run code frequently
4. **Use hints sparingly** - try to solve problems yourself

### When Stuck

1. **Re-read the instructions**
2. **Check the hints** (expandable sections)
3. **Review the background** information
4. **Peek at solution** as last resort

### After Completing

1. **Compare with solution** - learn different approaches
2. **Try bonus challenges** - extend your learning
3. **Document learnings** - update your notes
4. **Share and discuss** - with study group

## 🔧 Common Issues

### Import Errors

```bash
# Make sure you're in virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install missing packages
pip install <package_name>
```

### API Key Issues

```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   # Linux/Mac
echo %ANTHROPIC_API_KEY%  # Windows

# Or add to .env file
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key" >> .env
```

### Data File Not Found

```python
# Use Path for cross-platform paths
from pathlib import Path

data_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "data" / "file.csv"
```
