## Tips for Success

1. **Read the challenge description carefully** - hints are often embedded
2. **Check all provided files** - flags can be anywhere
3. **Try the obvious first** - search for "FLAG{" before complex analysis
4. **Use the labs as reference** - techniques from labs apply to CTFs
5. **Take notes** - track what you've tried
6. **Use hints if stuck** - they cost points but help you learn

## Scoring

- Each challenge has a point value based on difficulty
- Hints reduce points but teach important concepts
- No penalty for incorrect submissions
- Time is not tracked (learn at your own pace)

## Getting Help

- Review [Lab 00i: CTF Fundamentals](../labs/lab00i-ctf-fundamentals/) for CTF strategies
- Use AI assistants to help with decoding and analysis
- Community discussions (when available)
